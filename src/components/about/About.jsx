              This project, is the updated and modernized version of the
              original website which has been developed using Angular.js in
              2016.
              <br />
              If you want to compare the original website to this one, check

            </h5>
            <p>
              In this version, we recreated the same project using React.js
              framework, instead of Angular.js and also tried to implement more
              modern methods and technologies in order to convey better user
              experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is worth noting that, this is not an exact imitation of the
              official website.
              <br />
              So, there would definitely be some minor differences between these
              two applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              By developing this web application, we just tried to demonstrate
              our technical skills to whom may it concern and have no other
              meanings. <br />
              Hopefully, we have achieved our goals, here.
